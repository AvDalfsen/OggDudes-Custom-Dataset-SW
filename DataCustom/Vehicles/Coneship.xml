    [H3]Coneship[h3]

Coneships are small, inefficient, and utterly unsafe vessels indigenous to Selonia. These primitive vessels are nothing more than truncated cones with bell-shaped reaction drives on the wide end. The prow contains the cockpit, and room for two pilots and possibly a couple of passengers. Nobody flies coneships anymore if they can help it, though some dens maintain these vessels for dire emergencies.</Description>
