Dataset for OggDude's character generator 2.3.4.0.

## Installation

Create a folder where you will store the Character Generator and the dataset. Create two subfolders, one called `character_generator` and the other called `custom_dataset`.

Download the [OggDude's Character Generator](https://www.swrpgcommunity.com/gm-resources/apps-dice-utilities/oggdudes-generator) zip file and unzip it inside the `character_generator` folder. Executables and other files should be unzipped right into the `character_generator` folder, not into a subfolder.

Download the latest dataset from this repository and move the `DataCustom` folder into the `custom_dataset` folder. (You can delete the rest of the files and folders from the zip file.)

Run the Character Generator launcher `SWCharGenLauncher.exe` and set the `Data Path` to the `custom_dataset` folder. If you prefer, you can use relative path but you will have to check the `Make path relative to install directory` checkbox.

## Usage

The dataset is ready to use. Start the Character Generator and create a new character. You will see the full description of the species, careers, specializations, etc. in the appropriate tabs.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the dataset, you can do so by forking the repository, making changes and creating a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

The dataset's quality is almost entirely because of the hard work of @nlx3647 and @AvDalfsen. Thank you both for your dedication and effort. And thanks to all the contributors who have helped (and will help) improve the dataset

And of course, thanks to OggDude for creating the Character Generator and making it available to the community.
