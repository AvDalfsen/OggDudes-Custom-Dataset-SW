# dataset
Dataset for OggDude's character generator 2.3.4.0.

This is ONLY the Dataset_Full_Dataset folder.

I might add some instructions on how to set it up, but usually I just close the character generator, copy the files in, clear cache, and start up the GM tools to re-index everything.

The 2.2.1.0 branch has the files in it for the previous version.
The 2.3.4.0 branch has all datasets I have loaded, inclusing some personal ones with images from X-Wing: Alliance. Great game. Great ships.
