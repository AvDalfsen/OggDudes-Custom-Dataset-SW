# dataset
Dataset for OggDude's character generator 2.3.4.0.

This is ONLY the Dataset_Full_Dataset folder.

I might add some instructions on how to set it up, but usually I just close the character generator, copy the files in, clear cache, and start up the GM tools to re-index everything.

The 2.2.1.0 branch has the files in it for the previous version.
The 2.3.4.0 branch has all datasets I have loaded, inclusing some personal ones with images from X-Wing: Alliance. Great game. Great ships.

And because I haven't mentioned him, an enormous amount of credit to Oggdude, who personally has made it a ton of fun just to create characters, and more characters.

Also don't forget to check out Stoo Goff's Adversaries tool: http://swa.stoogoff.com/.
